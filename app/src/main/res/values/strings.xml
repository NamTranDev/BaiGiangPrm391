    <string name="txt_name">Rabbit</string>
    <string name="txt_desc">Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world\'s 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.</string>

    <string name="txt_dog" translatable="false">The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
        Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,
        and the modern wolf is the dog\'s nearest living relative.
        Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals
        and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</string>

    <string name="txt_dolphin" translatable="false">A dolphin is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea.
        Dolphin species belong to the families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae
        (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the New World river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins),
        and possibly extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin).
        There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.
        Dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound)
        Maui\'s dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Various species of dolphins exhibit
        sexual dimorphism where the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that
        are modified into flippers.

    <string name="txt_dragonfly" translatable="false">A dragonfly is a flying insect belonging to the infraorder Anisoptera below the order Odonata. About 3,000 extant species of true dragonflies are known. Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate regions. Loss of wetland habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the world. Adult dragonflies are characterized by a pair of large, multifaceted, compound eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings, sometimes with coloured patches, and an elongated body. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by structural colouration, making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly\'s compound eyes have nearly 24,000 ommatidia each.

    <string name="txt_turtle" translatable="false">Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a special shell developed mainly from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like other amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater,
        although many species live in or around water.</string>

    <string name="txt_goose" translatable="false">A goose (pl: geese) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae. This group comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese and white geese) and Branta (the black geese). Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller.
    The term "goose" may refer to such bird of either sex, but when paired with "gander", refers specifically to a female one (the latter referring to a male). Young birds before fledging are called goslings. The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump.

    <string name="txt_pig" tools:ignore="StringEscaping" translatable="false">The pig (Sus domesticus), often called swine (pl: swine),
        hog, or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members of the genus Sus, is an omnivorous, domesticated,
        even-toed, hoofed mammal. It is variously considered a subspecies of Sus scrofa (the wild boar or Eurasian boar)
        or a distinct species. The pig\'s head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (3 to 6 ft),
        and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb), with well-fed individuals even exceeding
        this range. The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed. Compared to other artiodactyls, a pig\'s head is relatively long and pointed. Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous, but pigs are omnivores, like their wild relative. Pigs grunt and make snorting sounds.

    <string name="txt_penguin" translatable="false">Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the order Sphenisciformes  of the family Spheniscidae . They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.

    <string name="txt_elephant" translatable="false">Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

    <string name="txt_ladybug" translatable="false">Coccinellidae
        is a widespread family of small beetles. They are commonly known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in
        the United Kingdom; "lady" refers to mother Mary. Entomologists use the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles
        to avoid confusion with true bugs. The more than 6,000 described species have a global distribution and are found in a variety of habitats. They are oval beetles with a domed back and flat underside. They are sexually dimorphic; adult females are larger than males. Many of the species have conspicuous aposematic (warning) colours and patterns, such as red with black spots, that warn potential predators that they taste bad.
